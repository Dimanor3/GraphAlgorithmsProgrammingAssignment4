GRAPH:
getGraphVertex(String astroId):
Will return the vertex that is specified by a certain astroId.

addGraphVertex(String astroId):
Will add the vertex of the certain astroId.

addGraphEdge(String startLocation, String endLocation, double value):
Will add the edge between the specifics start and vertices and add to the adjacency list.

toString():
Will create the view of the graph using the vertices.

getAstroInformation(String astroFileName)
Used to get the information of the file and creates the edges and vertices.
- Still don’t know how to fully use the GML parser or how to implement as it is really only for C++.

EDGE:
Just creates the edges.

VERTEX:
addAstroToAdjacencyList(Edge edgiesG):
Will create the adjacency list for the edges created.

toString():
Will show the representation of the vertexes. 

String pathAstroString():
Will return the string that will specify the path of the spanning tree from its root. Can use to print out the shortest path for Dijkstra’s algorithm if called.
